### Context
A pocket watch company required a logo. Pocket watches bring both style and accuracy, and so should their logo. The logo is designed so that the user can customize its color scheme. The logo is also showing the exact time on the users computer by animating the SVG.

The color is adjusted using three main buttons. One button controls the watch's body, one controls the face, and the last controls the watch's hands. The watch animation is done using the transform rotate property which updates at a set interval(every second).
